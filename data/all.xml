Although the query protein may not yet have a resolved structure, the 3D shape of a similar protein sequence can shed light on the putative shape and biological function of the query protein.</p>
]]></longdesc></resource><resource featured="false"><title>SNP Database Specialized Search Tools</title><url>/projects/SNP/</url><longdesc><![CDATA[<p>
A variety of tools are available for searching the SNP database, allowing search by genotype, method, population, submitter, markers and sequence similarity using BLAST. These are linked under &quot;&quot;Search&quot;&quot; on the left side bar of the dbSNP main page.</p>
]]></longdesc></resource><resource featured="true"><title>Science Primer</title><url>/About/primer/</url><longdesc><![CDATA[<p>
A basic introduction to the science and technology that underlies many of the NCBI resources. A great starting place for students and the general public, the Science Primer provides a basis for understanding the NCBI web site and mission, and provides direct links to many NCBI databases and tools. Topics include genome mapping, molecular modeling, mutations, microarrays (gene expression), genetics, pharmacogenomics (personalized medicine) and phylogenetics (evolutionary relationships).</p>
]]></longdesc></resource><resource featured="false"><title>Sequence Viewer</title><url>/projects/sviewer/</url><longdesc><![CDATA[<p>
Provides a configurable graphical display of a nucleotide or protein sequence and features that have been annotated on that sequence. In addition to use on NCBI sequence database pages, this viewer is available as an embeddable webpage component. <a href="/projects/sviewer/embedded.html">Detailed documentation</a> including an API Reference guide is available for developers wishing to embed the viewer in their own pages.</p>
]]></longdesc></resource><resource featured="true"><title>Splign</title><url>/sutils/splign</url><longdesc><![CDATA[<p>
A utility for computing cDNA-to-Genomic sequence alignments. It is based on a variation of the Needleman-Wunsch global alignment algorithm and specifically accounts for introns and splice signals. Due to this algorithm, Splign is accurate in determining splice sites and tolerant to sequencing errors.</p>
]]></longdesc></resource><resource featured="false"><title>TaxPlot</title><url>/sutils/taxik2.cgi</url><longdesc><![CDATA[<p>
A tool for comparing genomes on the basis of the protein sequences they encode. To use TaxPlot, one selects a reference genome and two species for comparison. Pre-computed BLAST results are then used to plot a point for each predicted protein in the reference genome, based on the best alignment with proteins in each of the two genomes being compared.</p>
]]></longdesc></resource><resource featured="true"><title>Taxonomy Browser</title><url>/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi?mode=Root</url><longdesc><![CDATA[<p>
Supports searching the taxonomy tree using partial taxonomic names, common names, wild cards and phonetically similar names. For each taxonomic node, the tool provides links to all data in Entrez for that node, displays the lineage, and provides links to external sites related to the node.</p>
]]></longdesc></resource><resource featured="true"><title>Taxonomy Common Tree</title><url>/Taxonomy/CommonTree/wwwcmt.cgi</url><longdesc><![CDATA[<p>
Generates a taxonomic tree for a selected group of organisms. Users can upload a file of taxonomy IDs or names, or they can enter names or IDs directly.</p>
]]></longdesc></resource><resource featured="false"><title>Taxonomy Statistics</title><url>/Taxonomy/taxonomyhome.html/index.cgi?chapter=STATISTICS&amp;uncultured=hide&amp;unspecified=hide</url><longdesc><![CDATA[<p>
Displays the number of taxonomic nodes in the database for a given rank and date of inclusion.</p>
]]></longdesc></resource><resource featured="false"><title>Taxonomy Status Reports</title><url>/Taxonomy/TaxIdentifier/tax_identifier.cgi</url><longdesc><![CDATA[<p>
Displays the current status of a set of taxonomic nodes or IDs.</p>
]]></longdesc></resource><resource featured="false"><title>Variation Reporter</title><url>/variation/tools/reporter </url><longdesc><![CDATA[<p>
A tool designed to search for and report human sequence variation data from <a href="/snp">dbSNP</a> and <a href="/dbvar">dbVar</a>. Individual variations or batch files can be submitted in HGVS, GVF or BED formats. Related information will be retrieved and reported in a downloadable table containing variation identifiers, nucleotide and cytogenetic band locations on various genomic assemblies, allele type and minor allele frequencies, predicted functional consequences (missense, nonsense, frameshift, splice site, etc.), reported clinical significance, and relevant citations.</p>
]]></longdesc></resource><resource featured="false"><title>VecScreen</title><url>/VecScreen/VecScreen.html</url><longdesc><![CDATA[<p>
A system for quickly identifying segments of a nucleic acid sequence that may be of vector origin. VecScreen searches a query sequence for segments that match any sequence in a specialized non-redundant vector database (UniVec).</p>
]]></longdesc></resource><resource featured="true"><title>Vector Alignment Search Tool (VAST)</title><url>/Structure/VAST/vast.html</url><longdesc><![CDATA[<p>
A computer algorithm that identifies similar protein 3-dimensional structures. Structure neighbors for every structure in MMDB are pre-computed and accessible via links on the MMDB Structure Summary pages. These neighbors can be used to identify distant homologs that cannot be recognized by sequence comparison alone.</p>
]]></longdesc></resource><resource featured="false"><title>Viral Genotyping Tool</title><url>/projects/genotyping/formpage.cgi</url><longdesc><![CDATA[<p>
This tool helps identify the genotype of a viral sequence. A window is slid along the query sequence and each window is compared by BLAST to each of the reference sequences for a particular virus.</p>
